# seed-rest-api
An API for getting pseudo-random seeds

I can't think of any real-world use cases for this, but seed.rest is a cool domain, so put this together.

## Development
In the project's directory run:
- `wrangler dev` - to run the project locally
- `wrangler publish` - to publish the project to Cloudflare Workers
